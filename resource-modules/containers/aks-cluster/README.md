* `aks_name` (required): The name of the Managed Kubernetes Cluster to create. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `aks_server_client_secret` (required): The Server Secret of an Azure Active Directory Application. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `aks_server_id` (required): The Server ID of an Azure Active Directory Application. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `aks_service_cidr` (required): The Network Range used by the Kubernetes service. This is required when network_plugin is set to azure. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `aks_subnet_id` (required): The ID of the Subnet where the Agents in the Pool should be provisioned. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `aks_version` (required): Version of Kubernetes specified when creating the AKS managed cluster. If not specified, the latest recommended version will be used at provisioning time (but won't auto-upgrade).
* `api_server_authorized_ip_ranges` (required): The IP ranges to whitelist for incoming traffic to the masters
* `client_id` (required):  The Client ID for the Service Principal. Changing this forces a new resource to be created
